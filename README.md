## Architectural Principles (Enforced by CI)

- **Rule #1 — One function per file, no big files:**
  Every function, React component, hook, and validation schema resides in its own dedicated file named after it. Files are bounded at ~300 lines, functions capped at 80 lines, and strictly one runtime export per file (`d11/single-export`).
- **Unified Theming System:**
  CSS tokens configured in `src/app/globals.css` with explicit contrast rules eliminating dark mode dropdown issues across all browsers and operating systems.
- **Fail-Fast Environment Validation:**
  Zero `process.env` leaks in client code. Validated strictly on server initialization via Zod schemas in `src/lib/env`.
- **Database Schema as Code:**
  All PostgreSQL schemas, functions, triggers, and RLS policies are versioned as ordered migrations under `supabase/migrations/`.
